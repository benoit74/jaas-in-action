## 1.4. JAAS

When Java code is executing, it needs to figure out which `Permissions` to apply to the current thread of execution. That is, when JAAS is doing a `Permission` check, it must answer the question “which `Permissions` are currently granted?” As mentioned above, JAAS associates `Permissions` with a “`Subject`.”[^1] In most cases, a `Subject` can be thought of as a “user,” but put more broadly, a `Subject` is any entity that Java code is being executed on behalf of. That is, a `Subject` need not always be a person who’s, for example, logged into a system with their username and password.

For example, when a person logs into a JAAS-enabled online banking system, the system creates a `Subject` that represents that user. JAAS resolves which `Permissions` the `Subject` has been granted, and associates those `Permissions` with the `Subject`. A “non-human” `Subject` could be another program that is accessing the application. For example, when the nightly batch-processing agent authenticates, or logs into, the system, a `Subject` that represents the agent is created, and the appropriate `Permissions` are associated with that `Subject`.

### 1.4.1. Authenticating Subjects

So, the first step in JAAS taking effect is logging a user into the system or “authenticating” the users. When a system authenticates a user, it establishes that the user is who they claim to be. As a real world example, when a bank asks one of its clients for their driver’s license and compares the picture to them, they’re authenticating the client’s identity. Similarly, when a user logs in to their bank’s online banking application, they’re prompted to provide a username and password. Because the user knows both of these items, called “credentials,” the online banking system trusts \[believes?\] the claim that they’re Joe User, and allows them to see their account balances, transfer money, and pay bills.

### 1.4.2. Principals: Multiple Identities

JAAS doesn’t directly associate a user’s identities with a `Subject`. Instead, each `Subject` holds onto any number of `Principals`. In the simplest sense, a `Principal` is an identity. Thus, a `Subject` can be thought of as a container for all of `Subject`’s identities, similar to how your wallet contains all of your id cards: driver’s license, social security, insurance card, or pet store club card. For example, a `Principal` could be:

* The user “jsmith,” which is John Smith’s login for the server.

* Employee number \#4592 which is John Smith’s employee number.

* John’s Social Security number which is used by the HR department.

Each of these identity `Principals` is associated with John Smith and, thus, once John authenticates with the JAAS-enabled system, each `Principal` is associated to his `Subject`.

Breaking out a `Subject`’s identities into `Principals` creates clear lines of responsibility between the two: `Principals` tell JAAS who a user is, while `Subject`s aggregate the user’s multiple identities. Also, this scheme allows for easier integration with non-JAAS authentication systems, such as single-signon services. For example, when a `Subject` is authenticated with a single-signon service, all of the different users are converted to `Principals`, and bundled into the `Subject`. In this scheme, the `Subject` is an umbrella for all the different identities the user, as represented by a `Subject`, can take on.

### 1.4.3. Subjects and Principals: Roles

In addition to `Principals` representing different identities of a `Subject`, they can also represent different roles the `Subject` is authorized to perform. For example, John Smith can perform the following of roles:

* Administer users, including approving new  user requests, deleting users, or resetting their passwords.

* Set system-wide configuration properties, like which mail server to use, or the name of the company.

Each of these roles can be encapsulated in JAAS as a `Principal`. Two roles could be created for the above items: User Administrator, System Administrator. As with identities, rather than directly associate each role’s abilities, or permissions, with aSubject, JAAS associates the role’s abilities with `Principals`. John Smith’s `Subject`, then, would have `Principals` that represent both of these Administrator roles.

Separating roles into their own `Principals` has the same dividing-up-responsibility advantages as separating identities. The primary benefit, however, is with managing and maintaining the user’s permissions. The management of who can do what in these systems can become extremely cumbersome and time consuming if a user’s abilities are directly associated with each `Subject` instead of a role-based `Principal`, which is associated with n- users.

For example, suppose we have a system with 5 User Administrator. If we followed a model where permissions were associated directly with `Subjects` instead of `Principals`, each `Subject` would be assigned the `Permission` to approve user requests, delete users, and reset their password. During the lifetime of the system, the permissions one of these User Administrators have will change. For example, suppose we decide that resetting a password for a user should only be done by the user: if a User Administrator reset their password, someone other than the user would know the password and might do evil things with that knowledge, or let it slip into the wrong hands. So, we have to modify the `Permission` of each of those 5 User Administrators, and remove the reset password permission. Similarly, we must visit each of the 5 User Administrators if we add a `Permission`.

While this may not seem too onerous a process for 5 users, doing it for more than 5 users can start to be tedious. For example, suppose we had a user base of 10,000 users, 4,032 of which you want to add the new permission “can delete documents.” If `Permissions` were directly associated with `Subjects`, you’d have to visit all 4,032 of those users! Instead, if the 4,032 users are all in the “Document Editor” role, as expressed by a `Principal` in JAAS, you need only edit that one role.

### 1.4.3. Credentials

In addition toPrincipals,Subjects also haveCredentials. The most common types of credential are a username and password pair. When you log in to your email account, for example, you’re prompted to enter your username and password.

Credentials can take many forms other than a username and password:

* A single credential, like your password for a voice mail system.

* A physical credential, like a garage door opener to open your garage.

* A digital certificate.

* A mix of physical and keyed-in credentials, like your ATM card and your PIN number.

* Biometric credentials, like your thumbprint or retinal scan.

Put simply, anything you use to prove your identity is a credential.

In JAAS, `Subjects` hold onto two types of credentials: public and private credentials. A username is, in most cases, a public credential: anyone can see your username. A password is, in most cases, a private credential: only the user should know their password. JAAS doesn’t specify an interface, or type, for credentials, as any `Object` can be a credential. Thus, determining the semantics of a credential—what that credential “means”—are left up to the code that uses the credential.

### 1.4.4. Principals and the policy

Once a `Subject` has been authenticated, having all of its `Principals` associated with it, JAAS uses the `Policy` service to resolve which `Permissions` the `Principals` are granted. A `Policy` is simply a singleton that extends the abstract class `java.security.Policy`. JAAS uses the `Policy`’s `implies()` and `getPermissions()` methods to resolve which `Permissions` a `Subject` has been granted.

The default `Policy` implementation is driven by a flat-file, allowing for declaratively configuring the `Permissions` pre-runtime. Because this implementation is file-driven, however, it’s effectively static: once your application starts, you can’t cleanly change the file’s contents, thus changing `Permissions`.

To provide a more dynamic, runtime `Permission` configuration, you’ll need to provide your own `Policy` implementation. You can swap out the `Policy` in effect through a VM argument, or at runtime. As with many other JAAS functions, the currently executing code must have permission to swap out the `Policy`.

### 1.4.5. Access Control: Checking for Permissions

Once a `Subject` is logged in, and has it’s `Principals` associated with it, JAAS can begin to enforce access control. Access control is simply the process of verifying that the `Subject` has been granted any rights required to executing the code. JAAS implements access control by wrapping `Permission` checks around blocks of code. The block of code could be an entire method, or a single line of code. Indeed, for best performance and the finest grain of security control, wrapping the smallest chunk of code possible is the best option.

Because of it’s nature, then, access control is often done in JAAS in a “try/catch” fashion: attempting to execute the protected code, and then dealing with security exceptions that are thrown due to failed `Permission` checks. `Permission` checking can also be done in a more query-related fashion: before executing a block of code, you can first see if the `Subject` has the appropriate permissions.

Once the `Subject` is authenticated, and the appropriate `Permissions` are loaded, JAAS- enabled code executes securely. Before the code executes, JAAS verifies that the `Subject` has the appropriate `Permissions`, throwing a security exception if the `Subject` does not. This is what is meant by JAAS’s claim of being “code centric”: the actual code being protected by `Permissions` often does the checking itself.

In most cases, the JAAS model of access control requires the code that is performing the sensitive action to do the permission checking itself. For example, instead of blocking access to a calling `java.io.File`’s `delete()` method, the method itself does the security check. This is usually the safest and quickest approach, as finding all the places that call `delete()` is much more difficult than simply putting access checks in the method itself. In this code-centric approach, the code must include `Permission` checks, and, thus, be knowable of which `Permissions` to check.

In some situations, such a model may be too cumbersome to maintain. Each time a new type of `Permission` is added that’s relevant to deleting a file, you must modify the `delete()`method to check for this `Permission`. Strategies that use Dynamic Proxies, declarative meta-information \(such as XDoclet or Annotations in J2SE 1.5\) or Aspect Oriented Programming, can be used to more easily solve problems like this. Indeed, those and similar strategies can often be used as a cleaner alternative to embedding access control code yourself.

### 1.4.6. Pluggability

As the above more code-level talk implies, JAAS is a highly pluggable system. What this means is that you can provide functionality to JAAS that wasn’t originally shipped with the SDK. It also means that you can change the way in which parts of JAAS work. For example, if the default flat-file based `Policy` doesn’t fit your requirements, you can implements and use your own, as later sections in this book will detail.

Unfortunately, as with other high-level frameworks, being pluggable also means there’s a bit of code that you’ll have to write to customize JAAS to your needs. The good news, however, is that you _can_ customize it to your needs.

For example, out of the box, JAAS has no idea how to identity users against your HR system. But, you can write a small amount of code that will do just this. Better, instead of having to conform the HR system to how JAAS works, you can customize JAAS to conform to how the HR system works. This is what “pluggable” means in relation to JAAS: you can add in new functionality that wasn’t previously there, and you’re not restricted to the original intent, design, and functionality of the framework.

The authentication system is pluggable primarily through providing custom `LoginModule` implementations, while the authorization system is pluggable by providing both custom `java.security.Permissionimplementations`, and `java.security.Policy`implementations. Chapters X and XX cover creating these custom implementations in great detail.

[^1]: Actually, in the Java security model,Permissions can be associated directly with code as well, further specified by the code’s origin. For example, you could specify that all classes loaded from the JAR somecode.jar be given a specific set ofPermissions. This will be covered in later chapters. For our purposes here, we’ll skip this detail.
