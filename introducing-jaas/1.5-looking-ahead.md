## 1.5 Looking ahead

The first part of the book covers the different components of JAAS, going into the above major components and “supporting classes” is much more detail. Included in this part will be an example of creating a database-backed `Policy` and custom `Permissions`.

While the first part has many examples of using these JAAS classes, the second part will provide more in-depth examples of common uses of JAAS, such as logging users in, managing user groups, and creating data-centric `Permissions`.

Finally, the appendixes will go over changes in JAAS in J2SE 5.0, standard J2SE `Permissions`, and a concise reference for configuring JAAS.

### Summary

Our first encounter with security in Java began with the need to provide a secure web application for accessing employee information. With that problem at hand, we started exploring the broad topic of Java security, and narrowed down to the Java Authentication and Authorization Service, or JAAS. We introduced JAAS's primary concepts and classes: permissions, policies, and the service layers needed to enforce the granting of permissions. While we dipped our toe into the code-waters of JAAS, our discussion remained fairly high- level so that we could establish the domain needed to dive into the code.
